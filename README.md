# Blood Donation Application


Introducing the MERN stack Blood Donation Application! This platform caters to three types of users: normal blood donors, organizations, and hospitals.

The application serves as a hub for blood donation, connecting donors with organizations and enabling hospitals to request blood from these organizations.

Normal blood donor users can register and provide their details, such as blood type and contact information. They can then offer to donate blood to organizations and contribute to saving lives.

Organizations play a crucial role in the application. They can register and manage blood donation events, collect donations from donors, and maintain a database of available blood types. Hospitals can reach out to organizations for blood requirements.

Hospitals, on the other hand, can register and request blood from organizations when they are in need. They can specify the blood type and quantity required, and organizations can respond accordingly.
